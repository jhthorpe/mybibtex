By considering the perturbation expansions of the true and CCSD energies, expressions are derived which give a perturbative correction for the effects of triple excitations which is consistent to fifth order. The resulting Ansatz, denoted CCSD-T, differs from the standard CCSD(T) correction even in the case where Brillouin's theorem holds, and ought to be superior, since it correctly includes more disconnected triples terms up to fifth order. This assertion is investigated by test calculations, which show that both methods deliver accurate results for both closed and open shell molecules.}

Most are based upon the factorized inclusion of the connected quadruple contribution (Qf) [J. Chem. Phys. 108, 9221 (1998)]. We compare the methods for the treatment of potential-energy curves for small molecules. These include CCSD(TQf), where the initial contributions of triple (T) and factorized quadruple excitations are added to coupled-cluster singles (S) and doubles (D), its generalization to CCSD(T̃Q̃f), where instead of measuring their first contribution from orders in H, it is measured from orders in H̃=e−(T1+T2)He(T1+T2); renormalized approximations of both, and CCSD(2) defined in [J. Chem. Phys. 115, 2014 (2001)]. We also consider CCSDT, CCSDT(Qf), CCSDTQ, and CCSDTQP for comparison, where T, Q, and P indicate full triple, quadruple, and pentuple excitations, respectively. Illustrations for F2, the double bond breaking in water, and N2 are shown, including effects of quadruples on equilibrium geometries and vibrational frequencies. Despite the fact that no perturbative approximation, as opposed to an iterative approximation, should be able to separate a molecule correctly for a restricted-Hartree–Fock reference function, some of these higher-order approximations have a role to play in developing new, more robust procedures.}",

Instead of addressing this problem by including additional electron correlation, we propose an explicit treatment of orbital relaxation via the use of “transition potential” reference orbitals, leading to a transition-potential coupled cluster (TP-CC) family of methods. One member of this family, in particular, TP-CCSD(12), is found to essentially eliminate the orbital relaxation error and achieve the same level of accuracy for the core-hole spectra as is typically expected of EOM-CCSD in the valence region. These results show that very accurate x-ray absorption spectra for molecules with first-row atoms can be computed at a cost essentially the same as that for EOM-CCSD.}",

The evidence for this departure is reviewed in detail by examining properties of the new potential surface and results of quasiclassical trajectory dynamics calculations using this surface. We also review very recent work on the dynamics governing the formation of radical products{,} H + HCO. These products can be formed on the T1 surface as well as the S0 one{,} and we present some results contrasting the dynamics on these two surfaces.

Due to the lack of experimental technique to directly observe the thermal vibration of atoms, the assignment is usually done by empirical trial-and-error method with considerable uncertainty. Here we demonstrate a successful study of intrinsic molecular vibration property based on first-principles molecular dynamics trajectory. A unified approach for calculating and assigning vibrational frequencies is developed and applied to solve some historical issues of benzene vibration. As a major achievement, the experimental frequencies of benzene a2g and b2u vibrations are reassigned, which breaks a deadlock in contemporary spectroscopic science and removes a cloud over the application of density-functional theory in organic chemistry. This work paves the way for the comprehensive realization of the first-principles spectroscopic research, and provides crucial clues to solve the century-old problems of Kekule resonance, π-deformation, and aromaticity.},

In fact, each of the years 1960, 1970, 1972, and 1977 is of historical value in the unraveling of the structure and energetics of the CH2 molecule, methylene. What took place for methylene, namely the establishment of credibility for theory, has subsequently taken place for many other molecules. Three important roles for quantitative theory are outlined: (i) theory precedes experiment; (ii) theory overturns experiment, as resolved by later experiments; and (iii) theory and experiment work together to gain insight that is afforded independently to neither. Several examples from each of the three classes are given.}}

The best full fourth-order MBPT result is 11.5 kcal/mol, demonstrating a residual infinite-order effect of 1.4 kcal/mol.}

abstract = {Canonical Van Vleck perturbation theory is used to transform vibrational Hamiltonians to effective Hamiltonians, where the form of the effective Hamiltonian is better suited to the study of highly excited vibrational states of polyatomic molecules than that of the original representation. The key advantage is that the solution to the full problem is obtained in the new representation using significantly smaller basis sets than are needed to obtain the solutions in the original representation. These transformations are implemented in a superoperator framework, using the program VANVLK. In this work, transformations are applied to the Hamiltonian operator itself, not the Hamiltonian matrix; this obviates the need for large basis sets. The tedious and complex algebra, required to perform these transformations, is implemented computationally. Combining these two features enable the investigations of vibrational dynamics in energy regimes and densities of states, unattainable by standard variational methods.}

The original focus was on high-accuracy wave function calculations for small molecules, but using local approximations combined with explicit correlation treatments, highly accurate coupled-cluster calculations are now possible for molecules with up to approximately 100 atoms. Recently, multireference correlation treatments were also made applicable to larger molecules. Furthermore, an efficient implementation of density functional theory is available. © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd. This article is categorized under: Software > Quantum Chemistry},

abstract = {The family of correlation consistent polarized valence basis sets (cc-pVXZ) has been extended to include sextuple zeta sets (cc-pV6Z) for the atoms boron through neon. Potential energy functions have been calculated with these sets for the electronic ground states of N2 and HF using a number of correlated wave functions: MP2, MP3, MP4, CCSD, CCSD(T) and CAS+1+2. Spectroscopic constants have been calculated for each level of theory and have been compared with experiment. Combining these results with those of prior studies, complete basis set limits have been estimated for Ee, De and re. It is found that the cc-pV6Z basis sets yield dissociation energies that are within 0.6–0.8 kcal mol−1 (N2) and 0.1 kcal mol−1 (HF) of the estimated CBS limits. Adding core-core and core-valence contributions to the CCSD(T) CBS limits yields De's that are within 0.1 kcal mol−1 of the experimental values.}

% Bross and Peterson DKH basis sets
@article{Bross-TCA-2013,
	Abstract = {New sets of all-electron correlation consistent triple- and quadruple-zeta basis sets have been developed for the 5p and 6p elements (In--Xe, Tl--Rn). For the 5p elements, the spin-free Douglas--Kroll--Hess (DKH) Hamiltonian truncated at second order was used, while for the 6p row, DKH3 was employed. The resulting cc-pVmZ-DK sets (m = T, Q) are designed to correlate the valence ns and np electrons, but both core--valence sets (cc-pwCVmZ-DK) for (n −1)spd correlation and diffuse-augmented sets (aug-cc-pVmZ-DK) for weak interactions have also been included. Benchmark DKH CCSD(T) calculations were carried out on the atoms for their first ionization potentials and electron affinities. Coupled cluster calculations of the near-equilibrium potential energy functions of 18 selected diatomic molecules were also carried out to determine their spectroscopic and thermodynamic properties. These results are extensively compared to those obtained using the analogous aug-cc-p(wC)VmZ-PP basis sets with their associated small-core pseudopotentials. For the quadruple-zeta quality basis sets, the mean unsigned differences were found to be just 1.4 m{\AA}for re, 0.7 cm−1 for ωe, and 0.2 kcal/mol for De with corresponding maximum differences of 4.8 m{\AA}, 4.3 cm−1, and 0.7 kcal/mol, respectively. Using all-electron DKH calculations with the present basis sets as corrections to the pseudopotential approximation appears to be most accurate when (n −1)d correlation is considered in both cases using aug-cc-pwCVQZ quality basis sets. The new DK basis sets exhibit similar basis set convergence toward the complete basis set (CBS) limit as the PP-based sets and hence should find utility in all-electron {$[$}T, Q{$]$} basis set extrapolations.},

This method is a simple and efficient way to get nearly exact frequencies for few‐mode model potentials. For more realistic potentials representing the dynamics of water and formaldehyde, the Mo/ller–Plesset treatment works equally as well. However, we find in general that MP2 level corrections give very accurate energies and additional corrections by higher level terms in the MP series are not substantial. Moreover, we find that for reference states on high energy manifolds degeneracies can result when higher level terms are included in the series. We discuss several ways to remove these degeneracies.}",

This Hamiltonian is expressed in terms of two arbitrarily defined internal distances and the angle between them. The body-fixed axis system is related to these coordinates in a general fashion. Problems with singularities and the domain of the Hamiltonian are discussed using specific examples of axis embedding. A number of commonly used coordinate systems including Jacobi, bond-length-bond-angle, and Radau coordinates are special cases of this Hamiltonian. Sample calculations on the H2S molecule are presented using all these and other coordinate systems. The possibility of using this Hamiltonian for reactive scattering calculations is also discussed.},

Here, we focus on LS-THC-MP3 and identify four variants with differing errors and efficiency characteristics. The performance of LS-THC-MP3 is analyzed for regular test systems with up to 40 first-row atoms. We also analyze the size-extensivity/size-consistency and grid- and basis set dependence of LS-THC-MP3. Overall, the errors observed are favorably small in comparison with standard density fitting, and a more streamlined method of generating grids via pruning is suggested. A practical crossover (the point at which LS-THC-MP3 is cheaper than the canonical method) is achieved around 240 correlated electrons. Despite several drawbacks of LS-THC that have been identified: an initial non-linearity of error when increasing system size, poor description of angular correlation, and a potentially large increase in error with the basis set size, the results show that LS-THC has significant potential for practical application to MP3 and other wavefunction methods.}",

Six species were identified and measured: methane, acetylene, ethylene, ethane, diacetylene, and hydrogen cyanide. The observations cover altitudes from 450 to 1600 kilometers above the surface. A mesopause is inferred from extraction of the temperature structure of methane, located at 615 km with a temperature minimum of 114 kelvin. The asymptotic kinetic temperature at the top of the atmosphere determined from this experiment is 151 kelvin. The higher order hydrocarbons and hydrogen cyanide peak sharply in abundance and are undetectable below altitudes ranging from 750 to 600 km, leaving methane as the only identifiable carbonaceous molecule in this experiment below 600 km.},

This model accounts for multiple coupling occuring on Titan between dynamics, haze, chemistry and radiative transfer. It was successful at explaining many observed features related to atmosphere state (wind, temperature), haze structure and chemical species distributions, recently, an important step in our knowledge about Titan has been done with Cassini and Huygens visits to Titan. In this context, we want to make the results of our model available for the scientific community which is involved in the study of Titan. Such a tool should be useful to give a global frame (spatial and time behaviour of physical quantities) for interpreting ground based telescope observations.},

@article{Horst-JGRP-2017,
	abstract = {Titan is the only moon with a substantial atmosphere, the only other thick N2 atmosphere besides Earth's, the site of extraordinarily complex atmospheric chemistry that far surpasses any other solar system atmosphere, and the only other solar system body with stable liquid currently on its surface. The connection between Titan's surface and atmosphere is also unique in our solar system; atmospheric chemistry produces materials that are deposited on the surface and subsequently altered by surface-atmosphere interactions such as aeolian and fluvial processes resulting in the formation of extensive dune fields and expansive lakes and seas. Titan's atmosphere is favorable for organic haze formation, which combined with the presence of some oxygen-bearing molecules indicates that Titan's atmosphere may produce molecules of prebiotic interest. The combination of organics and liquid, in the form of water in a subsurface ocean and methane/ethane in the surface lakes and seas, means that Titan may be the ideal place in the solar system to test ideas about habitability, prebiotic chemistry, and the ubiquity and diversity of life in the universe. The Cassini-Huygens mission to the Saturn system has provided a wealth of new information allowing for study of Titan as a complex system. Here I review our current understanding of Titan's atmosphere and climate forged from the powerful combination of Earth-based observations, remote sensing and in situ spacecraft measurements, laboratory experiments, and models. I conclude with some of our remaining unanswered questions as the incredible era of exploration with Cassini-Huygens comes to an end.},

@article{Coustenis_Icarus_2003,
	abstract = {We have analyzed Titan observations performed by the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) in the range 7--30 μm. The spectra obtained by three of the instruments on board the mission (the short wavelength spectrometer, the photometer, and the camera) were combined to provide new and more precise thermal and compositional knowledge of Titan's stratosphere. With the high spectral resolution achieved by the SWS (much higher than that of the Voyager 1 IRIS spectrometer), we were able to detect and separate the contributions of most of the atmospheric gases present on Titan and to determine disk-averaged mole fractions. We have also tested existing vertical distributions for C2H2, HCN, C2H6, and CO2 and inferred some information on the abundance of the first species as a function of altitude. From the CH3D band at 1161 cm−1 and for a CH4 mole fraction assumed to be 1.9% in Titan's stratosphere, we have obtained the monodeuterated methane-averaged abundance and retrieved a D/H isotopic ratio of 8.7−1.9+3.2 × 10−5. We discuss the implications of this value with respect to current evolutionary scenarios for Titan. The ν5 band of HC3N at 663 cm−1 was observed for the first time in a disk-averaged spectrum. We have also obtained a first tentative detection of benzene at 674 cm−1, where the fit of the ISO/SWS spectrum at R = 1980 is significantly improved when a constant mean mole fraction of 4 × 10−10 of C6H6 is incorporated into the atmospheric model. This corresponds to a column density of ∼ 2 × 1015 molecules cm−2 above the 30-mbar level. We have also tested available vertical profiles for HC3N and C6H6 and adjusted them to fit the data. Finally, we have inferred upper limits of a few 10−10 for a number of molecules proposed as likely candidates on Titan (such as allene, acetonitrile, propionitrile, and other more complex gases).},

Due to the fundamental similarity of TC to matrix multiplication and to the availability of optimized implementations such as the BLAS, tensor operations have traditionally been implemented in terms of BLAS operations, incurring both a performance and a storage overhead.

This implementation, TBLIS, achieves performance approaching that of matrix multiplication, and in some cases considerably higher than that of traditional TC. Our implementation supports multithreading using an approach identical to that used for matrix multiplication in BLIS, with similar performance characteristics.

	abstract = {Precise calculation of molecular electronic wavefunctions by methods such as coupled-cluster requires the computation of tensor contractions, the cost of which has polynomial computational scaling with respect to the system and basis set sizes. Each contraction may be executed via matrix multiplication on a properly ordered and structured tensor. However, data transpositions are often needed to reorder the tensors for each contraction. Writing and optimizing distributed-memory kernels for each transposition and contraction is tedious since the number of contractions scales combinatorially with the number of tensor indices. We present a distributed-memory numerical library (Cyclops Tensor Framework (CTF)) that automatically manages tensor blocking and redistribution to perform any user-specified contractions. CTF serves as the distributed-memory contraction engine in Aquarius, a new program designed for high-accuracy and massively-parallel quantum chemical computations. Aquarius implements a range of coupled-cluster and related methods such as CCSD and CCSDT by writing the equations on top of a C++ templated domain-specific language. This DSL calls CTF directly to manage the data and perform the contractions. Our CCSD and CCSDT implementations achieve high parallel scalability on the BlueGene/Q and Cray XC30 supercomputer architectures showing that accurate electronic structure calculations can be effectively carried out on top of general distributed-memory tensor primitives.},
